**Boutique Publisher**

By creatives, for creatives: coaching, advice, publication services

**Why?**

I know you might not think so, but you are extraordinarily talented. I see it in you. Everyone gets nervous. Your nervousness is your vulnerability at play, tap into it, use it, it is powerful. The more you do this the more often and easier it will be to fall into the flow state. 

Even so, you'll experience rejection, don't take it personally. Rejection is part of life, it just means that this particular opportunity didn't serve your future unfolding. Its not telling of you, your character, or your ability. Only your reaction is. 

We are made of stardust, we yearn to dance once more, up there in the twinkling lights. What do you say we go for it? 

Meet you there.
